      <div class="content">
        <p>The past year, I have been interested in the origins of plants, the transition from water to land facilited by mycellium. <br>
         One of the most interesting phenomena to emerge out of my readings is that of Lichen. Discovering these fascinating fungi in <br>
         Merlin Sheldrake's book, Entangled Life, "On June 18, 2016, the descent module of a Soyuz spacecraft landed on a bleak steppe<br>
         in Kazakhstan…” under the seats of the astronauts aboard “were hundreds of living organisms packed tightly in a box.  Among <br>
         the samples were several species of Lichen that had been sent into space for 1 and a half years as a part of the Biology and <br>
         Mars Experiment. BIOMEX is an international consortium of astrobiologists,  who use trays mounted on the outside of the ISS <br>
         - a piece of apparatus known as the EXPOSE facility to incubate biological specimens in extraterrestrial conditions." <br>
         (Entangled Life, Pg. 70) "A number of organisms with extreme tolerances have been sent into orbit, from bacterial spores, to <br>
         free living algae, to rock dwelling fungi.... Some can survive if shielded from the damaging effects of Solar radiation, but <br>
         few apart from a handful of Lichen species, are able to survive in full space conditions, drenched in unfiltered cosmic rays. </P>
       <p>So remarkable are these Lichen's abilities that they have become model life-forms for astrobiological research, ideal organisms <br>
        "to discern", as one researcher writes," the limits and limitations of terrestrial life". It isn't the first time Lichens have <br>
        helped humans to fathom the limits of life as we know it. Lichens are living riddles. Since the nineteenth century, they have <br>
        provoked fierce debate about what constitutes an autonomous individual. The closer we get to Lichens, the stranger they seem. <br>
        To this day. Lichens confuse our concept of identity and force us to question where one organism stops and another begins:" <br>
        (Entangled Life, Pg. 71) “Lichen are composed of two quite different entities, a fungus and an alga. [Simon] Schwanderer <br>
        proposed that the Lichen fungus (known today as the mycobiont) offered protection and acquired nutrients for itself and for <br>
        the algal cells. The algal partner (known today as the photobiont, a role sometimes played by photosynthetic bacteria) harvests<br>
        light and carbon dioxide to make sugars that produce energy. (Entangled Life. Pg. 72) "In 1877, the German Botanist Albert Frank<br>
        coined the word symbiosis to describe the living together of fungal and algal partners. In his study of Lichens, it had become <br>
        clear to him that a new word was required, one that didn't prejudice the relationship it described... Scientists made a number of <br>
        major new symbiotic claims in the years that followed... All cited the dual hypothesis of Lichens in support of their ideas.... <br>
        Lichens, in other words, quickly grew into a biological principle. They were a gateway organism to the idea of symbiosis, an idea <br>
        that ran against the prevailing currents in evolutionary thought in the late-nineteenth and early-twentieth centuries... In the wake<br>
        of the dual hypothesis, evolution could no longer be thought of solely in terms of competition and conflict. Lichens had become a <br>
        typecase of interkingdom collaboration.” (Entangled Life Pg.73) "Lichens encrust as much as 8 percent of the planet's surface, an <br>
        area larger than that covered by tropical rainforests. They clad rocks, trees, roots, fences, cliffs, and the surface of deserts. <br>
        Some are a drab camouflage. Some are lime-green or electric-yellow. Some look like stains, others like small shrubs, others like <br>
        antlers. Some leather and droop like batwings… Some live on beetles, whose lives depend on the camouflage the Lichen provides. <br>
        Untethered Lichens-known as ‘vagants’ or 'ecratics’ blow around and don't live their lives on anything in particular…” Biologist <br>
        and Author of Entangled Life goes on to write “I have been most captivated by Lichens on the islands off the coast of British <br>
        Columbia on the west coast of Canada. Seen from above, the coastline frays into the ocean. There is no hard edge. The land comes <br>
        undone gradually into inlets and sounds, and then into channels and passages. Hundreds of islands scatter off the coast. Some are no<br>
        bigger than a whale, the largest, Vancouver Island, is half the length of Britain. Most of the islands are solid granitic rock, the <br>
        tops of Submarine hills and valleys worn smooth by glaciers... I've spent hours absorbed in the worlds that they [Lichen] make <br>
        - islands of life in a sea of rock. The names used to describe Lichens... Crustose (crusty), Foloise (Leaty), Squamulose (Saly), <br>
        Leprose (Dufty), fruticose (Branched). Fruticose Lichens drape and tuft, Crustose and Squamulose... Creep and seep, Foloise... Layer <br>
        and flake (Entangled Life Pg. 74)</p> 
        <p>“Some prefer to live on east-facing surfaces, some on the west. Some choose to live on exposed ledges,<br>
        others in damp grooves. Some wage slow wars, repelling or disrupting their neighbours. Some inhabit the surfaces left exposed when other <br>
        Lichens have died and flaked off. They come to resemble the archipelagos and continents of an unfamiliar atlas; which is how Rhizocarpon <br>
        geographicum, or the 'map Lichen’, got its name. The oldest surfaces are pitted by centuries of lichenous life and death, Lichen's fondness<br>
        for rock has changed the face of the planet and continues to do so, sometimes literally. In 2006, the faces of the presidents carved into Mount<br>
        Rushmore were pressure hosed, removing more than 60 years of lichenous growth in the hope of extending the lifetime of the Memorial. The <br>
        presidents aren't alone. "Every monument,” writes the Poet Drew Milne, “has a Lichen Lining”. In 2019, the residents of Easter Island launched<br>
        a campaign to scrub Lichens off of hundreds of monumental stone heads, or moai. Described by locals as "Leprosy”, Lichens are deforming the <br>
        features of the statue to a Clay-like consistency. Lichens mine minerals from rock in a twofold process known as "weathering". They use an <br>
        arsenal of powerful acids and mineral binding compounds to dissolve and digest the rocks. When Lichens die and decompose they give rise to the <br>
        first soils in new ecosystems. Lichens are how the inanimate mineral mass within rocks is able to cross over into the metabolic cycles of the <br>
        living. A portion of the minerals in YOUR body is likely to have passed through a Lichen at some point. Whether on tombstones in a graveyard, or<br>
        encased within slabs of Antarctic granite, Lichens are go-betweens that inhabit the boundary dividing life and non-life.”(Entangled Life Pg. 75)<br>
        These organisms are all around us, providing insight into our creation and potentially how fungi could have played into our evolution. “The BIOMEX<br>
        team… wrestle with the question of panspermia, from the Greek pan meaning all and sperma meaning "seed"; Panspermia deals with the question of <br>
        whether planets are islands, and whether life can travel through space between Celestial bodies. It is an idea that has circulated since antiquity...<br>
        Some advocates argue that life itself arrived from other planets. Some propose instead that life evolved on Earth and elsewhere, and periods of <br>
        dramatic evolutionary novelty on Earth were triggered by the arrival of fragments of life from space. Others argue instead for a "Soft panspermia”, <br>
        where life itself evolved on Earth but the Chemical building blocks required for life arrived from space. There are many hypotheses as to how <br>
        interplanetary transport might take place. Most are variations on a theme: Organisms get trapped within asteroids or other debris ejected from planets<br>
        during collisions with meteorites, and hurtle through space before colliding with another planetary body on which they may or may not be able to make a<br>
        life. In the late 1950s, as the United States prepared to send rockets into space, the biologist Joshua Lederberg became concerned about the prospect of<br>
        terrestrial contamination... Humans were now able to spread earthly organisms to other parts of the solar system. More worrying is the thought that humans<br>
        could bring back to Earth alien organisms that could cause ecological disruption - or worse, wreak havoc as diseases." (Entangled Life, Pg. 75-77)</p>
       <p>One thing that does worry me, thinking about the potential earthly contaminations on other planets and vice versa. In 2018, SpaceX launched Elon Musk's<br>
        personal Tesla Roadster aboard the Falcon Heavy rocket on a test flight. The car was not sterilized to NASA's planetary protection standards. NASA later <br>
        acknowledged that the car "likely carried Earth microbes into space”. At the time it was considered "Low-risk as it was s test mission with no Intended <br>
        planetary target”. What I guess they either fail to realize, or most likely don't care about, is that no matter the intention, the potential harm it could<br>
        cause to an extraterrestrial ecology is troublesome and real. It exemplifies a wider disregard of consequences, potential or certain.</p>
       <p>Planetary protection is the practice of avoiding biological contamination, both Forward and Backwards. These are instituted by NASA following COSPAR <br>
        (Committee on space research) guidelines. If we continue on the path that we seem to be heading down, with Elon Musk's pleas for rapid Mars colonization,<br>
        Jeff Bezos's "Blue origin" launching its 11th human flight aboard the New Shepard rocket "a brief sub-orbital journey lasting 10 minutes and 21 seconds, <br>
        reaching about 62 miles above Earth, with Pop sensation Katy Perry onboard; Only the worst people are going to get to to space, and as societies standards<br>
        decline as we are seeing, Planetary protection will surely suffer as well. “Life on Earth could no longer be considered a genetically closed system, a <br>
        planetary island in an uncrossable sea. Just as bacteria could fast-foward evolution by picking up DNA horizontally, so the arrival of foreign DNA on <br>
        Earth could short-circuit the otherwise - "tortuous process of evolution”, with potentially catastrophic consequences.” (Entangled Life Pg. 80)<br>
