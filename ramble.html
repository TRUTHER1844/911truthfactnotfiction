      <h2>HOMOSEXUALITY: and the urge to sin</h2>

      <div class="content">
        <p>Yesterday I asked ChatGPT: What would the moral, psychological or physical benefit to engaging in homosexuality in either thought or practice be?" 

It then gave me nothing but soy talking points.

"In secular ethics, morality often involves consent, well-being, and harm reduction. In this view, engaging in same-sex relationships can be morally neutral or even positive if it fosters love, honesty, and respect between consenting adults."

All this being predicated on subjective morals, but we'll touch on that later.

It then references the proposed psychological benefits of indulging in sodomy...

"Scientific studies (when free from moral frameworks) show potential psychological benefits for LGBTQ+ individuals when they can safely express their orientation:

Reduced mental distress: Hiding or repressing same-sex attraction is linked to depression, anxiety, and internalized shame. Open acceptance can improve mental health.

Authentic relationships: Forming intimate bonds (emotional or romantic) in alignment with oneâ€™s orientation fosters psychological well-being.

Belonging and identity integration: Acceptance (internal and social) is associated with higher self-esteem and life satisfaction."

A calvacade of poorly constructed reasoning based on "radical empathy". It's <strong>[ChatGPT]</strong> final sentiment on the physical repercussions of homosexuality was particularly humorous:

"Physical benefits stem from typical relationship factors: companionship, reduced stress, and sexual health (with safe practices).


Potential risks:

Same as with heterosexual relationships: STIs if unsafe practices are used.

Some research shows certain sexual practices (anal intercourse, for instance) have higher medical risks if not done safely."

Safest way to not rupture your asshole is not have anal sex.... shocker.

I then wondered, couldn't repression of pedophilic thoughts be harmful to one's own brain? That doesn't seem like a justification for participating in that behavior, as I am sure just like with pedophilia (a disorder one is born with), these feelings can be managed and curved. 

We should not participate in things simply because they feel good, and feeling good makes us happy. 

That doesn't mean that thing is actually good for us, just that we are selfishly delving into our base desires, desires that only benefit us short term, all of these benefits that you have listed for homosexuality are 1, subjective, 2, can be achieved better and easier through heterosexuality, and 3 are surface level benefits. Do you not agree that instead of engaging in homosexuality, one could seek inner peace, working on themselves until they are no longer burdened with unnatural impulses? Even so, increased homosexuality (ie shifting the goal post from: seek relationship for a partner to have kids with - to - increased casual sex, decreased intimacy, subsequently less children, at least less children in happy stable nuclear families) has had unforseen consequences on our current society. The beauty standards have been raised from natural beauty to women looking like drag queens, stuffed in to candy wrapper skin tight dresses, parading themselves around in bars like beauty pagent queens.
