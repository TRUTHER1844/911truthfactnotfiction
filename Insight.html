        <p>My research into the building blocks of reality have accidentally led me into the mystical world of fungi and its origins. One of the most interesting phenomena to emerge out of my readings is that of Lichen. Discovering these fascinating fungi in Merlin Sheldrake's book, Entangled Life, "On June 18, 2016, the descent module of a Soyuz spacecraft landed on a bleak steppe in Kazakhstan…” under the seats of the astronauts aboard “were hundreds of living organisms packed tightly in a box.  Among the samples were several species of Lichen that had been sent into space for 1 and a half years as a part of the Biology and Mars Experiment. BIOMEX is an international consortium of astrobiologists,  who use trays mounted on the outside of the ISS - a piece of apparatus known as the EXPOSE facility to incubate biological specimens in extraterrestrial conditions." (Entangled Life, Pg. 70) "A number of organisms with extreme tolerances have been sent into orbit, from bacterial spores, to free living algae, to rock dwelling fungi.... Some can survive if shielded from the damaging effects of Solar radiation, but few apart from a handful of Lichen species, are able to survive in full space conditions, drenched in unfiltered cosmic rays. So remarkable are these Lichen's abilities that they have become model life-forms for astrobiological research, ideal organisms "to discern", as one researcher writes," the limits and limitations of terrestrial life". It isn't the first time Lichens have helped humans to fathom the limits of life as we know it. Lichens are living riddles. Since the nineteenth century, they have provoked fierce debate about what constitutes an autonomous individual. The closer we get to Lichens, the stranger they seem. To this day. Lichens confuse our concept of identity and force us to question where one organism stops and another begins:" (Entangled Life, Pg. 71) “Lichen are composed of two quite different entities, a fungus and an alga. [Simon] Schwanderer proposed that the Lichen fungus (known today as the mycobiont) offered protection and acquired nutrients for itself and for the algal cells. The algal partner (known today as the photobiont, a role sometimes played by photosynthetic bacteria) harvests light and carbon dioxide to make sugars that produce energy. (Entangled Life. Pg. 72) "In 1877, the German Botanist Albert Frank coined the word symbiosis to describe the living together of fungal and algal partners. In his study of Lichens, it had become clear to him that a new word was required, one that didn't prejudice the relationship it described... Scientists made a number of major new symbiotic claims in the years that followed... All cited the dual hypothesis of Lichens in support of their ideas.... Lichens, in other words, quickly grew into a biological principle. They were a gateway organism to the idea of symbiosis, an idea that ran against the prevailing currents in evolutionary thought in the late-nineteenth and early-twentieth centuries... In the wake of the dual hypothesis, evolution could no longer be thought of solely in terms of competition and conflict. Lichens had become a typecase of interkingdom collaboration.” (Entangled Life Pg.73) "Lichens encrust as much as 8 percent of the planet's surface, an area larger than that covered by tropical rainforests. They clad rocks, trees, roots, fences, cliffs, and the surface of deserts. Some are a drab camouflage. Some are lime-green or electric-yellow. Some look like stains, others like small shrubs, others like antlers. Some leather and droop like batwings… Some live on beetles, whose lives depend on the camouflage the Lichen provides. Untethered Lichens-known as ‘vagants’ or 'ecratics’ blow around and don't live their lives on anything in particular…” Biologist and Author of Entangled Life goes on to write “I have been most captivated by Lichens on the islands off the coast of British Columbia on the west coast of Canada. Seen from above, the coastline frays into the ocean. There is no hard edge. The land comes undone gradually into inlets and sounds, and then into channels and passages. Hundreds of islands scatter off the coast. Some are no bigger than a whale, the largest, Vancouver Island, is half the length of Britain. Most of the islands are solid granitic rock, the tops of Submarine hills and valleys worn smooth by glaciers... I've spent hours absorbed in the worlds that they [Lichen] make - islands of life in a sea of rock. The names used to describe Lichens... Crustose (crusty), Foloise (Leaty), Squamulose (Saly), Leprose (Dufty), fruticose (Branched). Fruticose Lichens drape and tuft, Crustose and Squamulose... Creep and seep, Foloise... Layer and flake (Entangled Life Pg. 74) “Some prefer to live on east-facing surfaces, some on the west. Some choose to live on exposed ledges, others in damp grooves. Some wage slow wars, repelling or disrupting their neighbours. Some inhabit the surfaces left exposed when other Lichens have died and flaked off. They come to resemble the archipelagos and continents of an unfamiliar atlas; which is how Rhizocarpon geographicum, or the 'map Lichen’, got its name. The oldest surfaces are pitted by centuries of lichenous life and death, Lichen's fondness for rock has changed the face of the planet and continues to do so, sometimes literally. In 2006, the faces of the presidents carved into Mount Rushmore were pressure hosed, removing more than 60 years of lichenous growth in the hope of extending the lifetime of the Memorial. The presidents aren't alone. "Every monument,” writes the Poet Drew Milne, “has a Lichen Lining”. In 2019, the residents of Easter Island launched a campaign to scrub Lichens off of hundreds of monumental stone heads, or moai. Described by locals as "Leprosy”, Lichens are deforming the features of the statue to a Clay-like consistency. Lichens mine minerals from rock in a twofold process known as "weathering". They use an arsenal of powerful acids and mineral binding compounds to dissolve and digest the rocks. When Lichens die and decompose they give rise to the first soils in new ecosystems. Lichens are how the inanimate mineral mass within rocks is able to cross over into the metabolic cycles of the living. A portion of the minerals in YOUR body is likely to have passed through a Lichen at some point. Whether on tombstones in a graveyard, or encased within slabs of Antarctic granite, Lichens are go-betweens that inhabit the boundary dividing life and non-life.”(Entangled Life Pg. 75) These organisms are all around us, providing insight into our creation and potentially how fungi could have played into our evolution. “The BIOMEX team… wrestle with the question of panspermia, from the Greek pan meaning all and sperma meaning "seed"; Panspermia deals with the question of whether planets are islands, and whether life can travel through space between Celestial bodies. It is an idea that has circulated since antiquity... Some advocates argue that life itself arrived from other planets. Some propose instead that life evolved on Earth and elsewhere, and periods of dramatic evolutionary novelty on Earth were triggered by the arrival of fragments of life from space. Others argue instead for a "Soft panspermia”, where life itself evolved on Earth but the Chemical building blocks required for life arrived from space. There are many hypotheses as to how interplanetary transport might take place. Most are variations on a theme: Organisms get trapped within asteroids or other debris ejected from planets during collisions with meteorites, and hurtle through space before colliding with another planetary body on which they may or may not be able to make a life. In the late 1950s, as the United States prepared to send rockets into space, the biologist Joshua Lederberg became concerned about the prospect of terrestrial contamination... Humans were now able to spread earthly organisms to other parts of the solar system. More worrying is the thought that humans could bring back to Earth alien organisms that could cause ecological disruption - or worse, wreak havoc as diseases." (Entangled Life, Pg. 75-77) One thing that does worry me, thinking about the potential earthly contaminations on other planets and vice versa. In 2018, SpaceX launched Elon Musk's personal Tesla Roadster aboard the Falcon Heavy rocket on a test flight. The car was not sterilized to NASA's planetary protection standards. NASA later acknowledged that the car "likely carried Earth microbes into space”. At the time it was considered "Low-risk as it was s test mission with no Intended planetary target”. What I guess they either fail to realize, or most likely don't care about, is that no matter the intention, the potential harm it could cause to an extraterrestrial ecology is troublesome and real. It exemplifies a wider disregard of consequences, potential or certain.

Planetary protection is the practice of avoiding biological contamination, both Forward and Backwards. These are instituted by NASA following COSPAR (Committee on space research) guidelines. If we continue on the path that we seem to be heading down, with Elon Musk's pleas for rapid Mars colonization, Jeff Bezos's "Blue origin" launching its 11th human flight aboard the New Shepard rocket "a brief sub-orbital journey lasting 10 minutes and 21 seconds, reaching about 62 miles above Earth, with Pop sensation Katy Perry onboard; Only the worst people are going to get to to space, and as societies standards decline as we are seeing, Planetary protection will surely suffer as well.

“Life on Earth could no longer be considered a genetically closed system, a planetary island in an uncrossable sea. Just as bacteria could fast-foward evolution by picking up DNA horizontally, so the arrival of foreign DNA on Earth could short-circuit the otherwise - "tortuous process of evolution”, with potentially catastrophic consequences.” (Entangled Life Pg. 80)

<p>For the past few months I've been off and on reading Merlin Sheldrake's ‘Entangled Life’, and a part I found particularly peculiar was when the book discussed a paper called “Queer theory for Lichens" and its implication for both humans and Lichen. A worrying aspect of this book's possible interpretation of this paper and the parallels being drawn between Lichen anatomy and human sexreality. The author of the paper argues that lichens are ‘queer beings’ that present ways for humans to thank beyond a rigid binary framework: The identity of Lichens is a question rather than an answer known in advance. In turn, Spribille has found queer theory a helpful framework to apply to Lichens." (Entangled Life pg. 90-91) Now this, I can agree with, furthermore I can agree with what else was written about: that “it is no longer possible to conceive of any organism, humans included, as distinct from the microbial communities they share a body with. The biological identity of most organisms can't be pried apart from the life of there microbial symbionts… We can't be defined on anatomical grounds because our bodies are shared with microbes and consist of more microbial cells than our “own” - cows can't eat grass, for example, but their microbial populations can, and Cow's bodies have evolved to house the microbes that sustain them. Neither can we be defined developmentally, as the organism that proceeds from the fertilization of an animal egg, because we depend, like all mammals, on our symbiotic partners to direct parts of our developmental programs." (Entangled Life, pg. 91) This raises very interesting questions about human identity and development, what parts of consciousness are a result of these relationships? where does the human begin and the microbes end. However, the concerning aspect, is the relation to human sexual identity and expression. Sheldrake writes " The human binary view has made it difficult to ask questions that aren't binary," he [Spribille] explained. “Our strictures about sexuality make it difficult to ask questions about sexuality, and so on. We ask questions from the perspective of our cultural context. And this makes it extremely difficult to ask questions about complex symbioses like Lichen because we think of ourselves as autonomous individuals and so find it hard to relate." (Entangled Life, pg. 91) Now the only reason I can see any of that being relevant is if Sheldrake was quoting it as evidence to normalize or justify homosexuality or transgenderism. Suggesting however, that because Lichenologists struggle with with precise autonomy for LICHEN, and drawing a parallel between them being hesitant to accept Lichen's confusing taxonomy, is analogous to potential homophobia or transphobia within society or science, is mind boggingly retarted. For starters, Society and science haven't struggled with the topic of sexuality for over 3 decades, if anything I would suggest a far higher level of rigidity to the binary. Asking questions about sexuality is one thing, but modern science has an issue with the answers. Although the overarching question “where does the human begin and the microbe end? is astoundingly important. Lichen's offer a great insight into our origins and development, the possibility granted by Lichen's ability to survive in space, that external cosmic specimens could have potentially played a part in human evolution, this being the case if Lichens did indeed come from space.</p>
